### About
- This is a quick project where I analyzed, prepared, and ploted data in python in order to answer questions in a meaningful way about the life expectancy and GDP of six countries.

### Collaborators
This is my own personal project, thus I am not looking for collaborators. Any suggestions or advice are welcome.

### TODO
- Open to ideas.
